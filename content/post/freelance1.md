I took a career break while I was still living in the tropics and had the chance to do a little freelance work in between SCUBA dives. One of my first gigs was to help a client to evaluate their sales target setting process. Their team was split into two groups and some rumours were circulating that one group had their targets set too easy. I was able to recommend some improvements based on some very simple statistical tests. With the client's permission, I've posted a brief write-up of the [essential points](https://www.rpubs.com/julianhatwell/tc_sales) which demonstrate how easy it is to run Bayesian equivalents of standard statistical tests, using the [BayesianFirstAid](http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/01/bayesian-first-aid/) package by Rasmus Bååth.
