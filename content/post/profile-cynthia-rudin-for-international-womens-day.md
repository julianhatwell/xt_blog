### Profile: Cynthia Rudin

Today, for International Women's Day, I wanted to share my huge respect for Cynthia Rudin. She is a leading academic in the research field in which I am currently involved for my PhD - interpretability in machine learning. Her work is very widely cited and comes up in all searches related to solving the "black box" problem of machine learning. She is a true thought leader.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_mwYWfI_sI) is excellent podcast where Cynthia succinctly and eruditely explains the current state, problems and solutions of ML interpretability. It's well worth a listen and, I believe, entirely understandable by non-expert listeners.

Here are a couple of profile sites where you can find out more about this brilliant and accomplished woman who is a true thought leader in Machine Learning and Data Science.

*Whenever I can - and not only on IWD - I try to raise the profile of prominent women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Under-representation and a lack of visible role-models is one barrier to increasing diversity and equality in any field. Certainly, there is no lack of talented women in STEM but if young women and girls at school aren't given examples of successful women, this can limit aspirations at the grass roots level.*
