### New technology reveals how artificial intelligence makes decisions

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is one of the hottest research areas in machine learning (ML) right now. It's not, as such, a new topic of interest; interpretability has been a cornerstone of statistics since the early era of the discipline. However, there is no doubt that there was increasing in interest in the mid-2010's and then a surge of activity following the release of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [DARPA's call for funding applications in 2017](https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/XAIProgramUpdate.pdf). This was right around the time I had settled on a related topic for my own PhD research and it's something I follow very closely - as you can probably tell by my blog's base URL!

It certainly seems to be DARPA that coined the term XAI. XAI encompasses all manner of research related to explainability and interpretability in ML. Their scope is broad, and includes not just explainable models (the antithesis of the infamous "black box" algorithms) but also inter-disciplinary research on the nature of explanations and the back-and-forth, question-answer dialogue ordinarily takes place between human actors explaining actions to one another.

It's fascinating to [read today](https://www.raytheon.com/news/feature/trust-machine) how far they have come towards this goal. Their model combines deep learning, image analysis with pixel or super-pixel saliency, a question-answer natural language paradigm and reinforcement learning to "reward" correctness of the analysis. Obviously, as a ML researcher and practitioner, this progress is fascinating to me. Nevertheless, as a humanist and pacificist, it saddens me when I consider how most of the world's greatest technological advances are rooted in and funded for military advancement.
