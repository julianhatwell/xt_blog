### Short Version:

I offer prospective partners/clients/employers a rare combination of skills and experience:
  
* technical expertise (machine learning, analytics, data science)
* senior management experience (strategic and operational, recruitment and talent development, org change)
* project leadership (program director, project manager, business analyst, Scrum Master, Scrum Product Owner, Kanban)
* soft/interpersonal skills (facilitator, trainer and educator, workshop design and delivery)

### Long Version:

I am a data professional with 15 yrs corporate experience and 4 years in academia. I hold an MSc in Business Intelligence. I am currently in full-time doctoral studies in data analytics and machine learning; specifically looking at the question of interpretability of black box models. This is a research area better known as "eXplainable Artificial Intelligence" or XAI.

I have held numerous technical leadership positions and run Agile web and software development teams of up to 25 reports and run technical programmes with annual budgets of several million GBP. I have a strong record in staff recruitment and development. My early career included roles in database administration and design, enterprise integration and asynchronous message-based services and management information systems, reports and forecasts using Microssoft SQL Server 2000/2005/2008 R2 enterprise editions.

I am also an experienced trainer, educator and workshop facilitator (product development and business analysis, team building, data literacy, customer relations and requirements gathering; to name a few).

I am an obsessive "life-long learner." I have completed over 25 MOOCs, a Master's degree as a mature student and am now in the third (and hopefully final) year of my PhD studies. I am also learning German as a fourth language, jumping out of Windows and getting into Linux, trying out Scala, Bayesian Stats, Grammatical Evolution and really anything that keeps my skills up to date.

In my spare time (haha) I'll be winding down in the gym or chewing the fat with a friend. Sometimes I listen to tribal ambient music, sometimes avant-garde death metal and sometimes somthing in between - but never while I'm working because I get synaesthesia and it is too distracting to watch the music happen in 3D shapes and colours. When I have serious down-time, I like to travel, hike, scuba dive and occasionally upload digital abstract doodles to Instagram.
